## A new kind of ad platform, built on consumer smiles and customer satisfaction.

With the rise of ad blockers and growing consumer impatience with ads, advertisers are investing huge budgets into creative advertisements that are often being ignored. On the user side, it is seen as an inconvenience to sit through an ad in order to watch a TV show or access a website. 

Cheddar brings the joy back into ads and ensures viewers engage emotionally with branded content. Instead of pay per click or pay per view, the Cheddar platform offers advertisers the ability to pay per smile. The siteâ€™s users can earn Smile Points by grinning while viewing online ads. Fifty years of psychology research has proven that making and holding a smile - regardless of how you initially feel - makes you happy. Your facial expressions actually alter your true emotions!  Cheddar leverages cutting-edge facial recognition technology (http://www.affectiva.com/) to encourage consumers to smile at advertisers' videos, and pays them based how intense and long they smile. This creates a true emotional association of joy or happiness with the products being promoted.

This project was built with the following tools:
  - React and Redux on the front-end
  - Node/Express and Sequelize/PostgreSQL on the back-end
  - Passport.js and bcrypt for authentication
  - Webpack as a build tool
  - Enzyme and Mocha for testing
  
In addition to the Affectiva SDK, Cheddar also utilizes APIs from Twitter and Stripe. The data visualization dashboard was built with a React implementation of the Highcharts library.
